# Travelling-website

The website created using HTML,CSS,PHP,MYSQL mimics the behavior of tour guide website. It first asks the client to register/login and the details of his place of origin and the destination state in India. User is then redirected to the webpage showing all the popular places along with their description and entry fees. It also provides services like booking a hotel of client's choice as well as the transport link using Google API for showing directions from the hotel to the destination place. For hotel reservation, client is supposed to make a payment. The expenditure depends on the number of days and number of people.
